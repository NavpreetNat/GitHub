# How to Push Changes to GitHub using GitBash

1.  **Open GitBash and Navigate to the 'main' folder using;**

```shell
cd main_folder
```

---

2.  **Then, instruct the terminal to add your changes to the queue of 'tracked files' ready to be be committed'.**

```shell
git add -A
```

---

3.  **Now we want to 'commit' these changes, adding the file as a bulk checkpoint ready to be pushed to the remote git repository.**

```shell
git commit -m "made some changes"
```

---

4.  **Finally, we are to push the changes to the online repository, thereby uploading the changed files from the local git repository to the remote one, updating the remote files.**

```shell
git push origin main
```

---

*and.... VIOLA! You've now pushed some changes.*

### High-five!

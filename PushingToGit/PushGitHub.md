# How to Push Changes to GitHub using GitBash

1.  Open GitBash and Navigate to the 'main' folder using;

```shell
cd main_folder
```

2.  Then, instruct the terminal to add your changes to the 'lobby', I guess..

```shell
git add -A
```

3.  Now we want to 'committ' these changes. Not sure what it means, but this is step 3.

```shell
git commit -m "made some changes"
```

4.  Finally, we are to push the changes to the online repository;

```shell
git push origin main
```

and.... VIOLA! You've now pushed some changes.

High-five!
